# ⚡ Algorithms in Java

This repository contains **implementations of core and advanced algorithms** using **Java 8+ features** (lambdas, streams, optionals where relevant).

It is designed to serve as a **reference and practice resource** for engineers preparing for **technical interviews**, competitive programming, and system design discussions.

🛠 How to Use

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/algorithms-java.git


Navigate to the topic (e.g., sorting/, graph/).

Run the algorithm files directly or integrate them into your projects.

Each implementation is written to be:

Readable (clean code, proper naming, comments)

Educational (includes explanation + complexity analysis)

Practical (ready to adapt in interviews or projects)

🎯 Why This Repo?

Covers must-have, good-to-know, and advanced algorithms for coding interviews.

Focused on Java 8+ best practices.

Serves as a handbook for quick revision before interviews.

📌 Future Enhancements

Add unit tests (JUnit) for each algorithm.

Add visual diagrams for key algorithms (like sorting and graph traversal).

Expand to multilang (Python, JS, TS) if needed.

🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please keep implementations clean, well-documented, and aligned with the repo structure.
